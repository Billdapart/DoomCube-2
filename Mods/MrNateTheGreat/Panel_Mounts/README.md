Magnetic clipping Doomcube V2 top/bottom panel attachment that allows for top and bottom panel installation after frame assembly.

GOALS: 
No loss of compatability with already cut panels
V0 Printable as the top/bottom panels are necessary to build printer but side panel mounts can be printed later.
Be multi-size compatible

STLs already in print orientation.  There is a 3.25mm bridge for the upper clips but should not require supports. Line width needs to be 0.4mm or lower for bridging to slice properly.

Uses 32 6x3mm magnets per panel set, so 64 magnets total.  

All parts should be printable on a V0.  The 350mm middle clips would need to be rotated 45 degrees to fit on V0 bed.
