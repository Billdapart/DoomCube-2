Magnetic clipping Doomcube V2 top/bottom panel attachment that allows for top and bottom panel installation after frame assembly.

GOALS: 
No loss of compatability with already cut panels
V0 Printable as the top/bottom panels are necessary to build printer but side panel mounts can be printed later.
Be multi-size compatible

STLs already in print orientation.  There is a 3.25mm bridge for the upper clips but should not require supports.

Uses 32 6x3mm magnets total.  All parts should be printable on a V0.  the 350mm middle clips would need to be rotated 45 degrees to fit.

Print x8 middle clips for whatever size Doomcube you have, and x2 of the short and long corner pieces and their mirror counterparts.  Upper and lower sections for each.
