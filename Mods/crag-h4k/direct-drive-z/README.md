# direct drive z

Based on joshmurrah's direct drive mod for the v2.4 - adapted to DOOM! 


### Notable Features

- reduces required parts and complexity of typical z drive motor units
- slot in the corner of the motor mount to give space for cabling that is passed through the 4040 extrusion frame
- GT2 grub screw access hole
- the key-baks gives a nice combination of jank and ingenuity ;)

## Tips

- the space between the motor and the DOOM cubes panel mounting is tight, may want to use m3 bhcs for mounting the panel
mounts to the extrusion
- you'll probably want to have two key-baks on your build; if so, double the amount in the key-bak holder's BOM below
