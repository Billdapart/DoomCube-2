# Doom-Cube

![DOOMCUBE](Images/DCLogo.png)


A mod for V2.4 designed by the Voron community, for the Voron community! Please note that it is a work in progress, design iterations are expected. The files are hosted on github so we have a log of the past history for the parts.

#### Key features:

-4040 vertical components to allow for insulation with air gap stock

-Top mounted Z drives

-Top mounted low voltage components

-Bottom mounted high voltage components



#### Changes required:

-4pcs 4040 extrusions (HFSB5-4040)

-New Z Idlers



#### Tips for printing parts:

-For any Voron stock parts, or the Z idlers, please use standard settings

-For skirts, etc, you may use other settings to reduce filament usage. Currently I am using: 0.3mm layer height, 2 perimeters, 2 bottom, 3 top, 20% infill. 

## BOM 
All extrusions are listed using Misumi part numbers.

### NOTE: Both square and rounded 4040 are listed, you only need 1 style, but if you are going with a scratch built and using the rounded you will also need stock voron 2020 verticals to go with it. The Rounded 4040 does not need to have holes drilled in them but you will need to drill holes in the stock 2020 to mount the 4040 to it with blind holes see [here](Images/404020-1.jpg) and [here](Images/404020-2.jpg) for an example
